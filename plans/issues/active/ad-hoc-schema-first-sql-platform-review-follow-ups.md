# Ad hoc issue: Schema-first SQL platform review follow-ups

Status: active, non-blocking

Owner: SQL compiler, schema tools, and verification

## Objective

Resolve the new mechanism findings from the final schema-first SQL platform
remediation review. These findings do not reopen the completed platform phase.

## Scope

- Make every generated profile annotation resolve through an explicit import or
  alias. Cover datetime, UUID, JSON, and network types.
- Diagnose a missing schema-profile import when a decorator names a configured
  profile. Do not capture unrelated decorators that also end in `.query`.
- Keep explicit user-owned PostgreSQL sequences in live schema evidence. Exclude
  only sequences that PostgreSQL creates as an identity implementation detail.
- Prove reproducible linked native SQL artifacts, not only reproducible Cargo
  check plans.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A generated profile with date, time, timestamp, UUID, JSON, IP, network,
  and MAC fields compiles without an undeclared annotation path.
- [ ] Generated imports and type annotations come from one closed mapping. A
  mutation test rejects an annotation whose import is missing.
- [ ] A configured but unimported profile decorator produces one targeted
  diagnostic with an import correction.
- [ ] An unrelated decorator such as `@cache.query` remains outside SQL
  discovery and does not produce the profile-import diagnostic.
- [ ] PostgreSQL live catalog tests retain explicit `CREATE SEQUENCE` and
  `ALTER SEQUENCE ... OWNED BY` objects.
- [ ] PostgreSQL live catalog tests exclude only implementation-owned identity
  sequences and preserve DDL-versus-introspection parity.
- [ ] Native build qualification links supported SQL artifacts twice from clean,
  locked, offline inputs and compares stable content hashes.
- [ ] Cross-target limitations are explicit. The qualification does not claim
  byte reproducibility for a target that it cannot link locally.
- [ ] Focused compiler, schema-tool, build-qualification, mutation, formatting,
  lint, HIR, and file-size checks pass.
- [ ] One exact-candidate external review and the applicable repository gates
  pass when this issue is selected for implementation.

## Source evidence

- Final implementation: [PR #3645](https://github.com/sifr-lang/sifr/pull/3645).
- The Milestone 18 remediation review returned `SATISFIED` for the four original
  blockers on `c0c6ae255fc605fc58a24d93a15d5a08b8126121` and reported these four
  findings as new follow-up work.
- The archived phase record contains the complete validation, review, gate, and
  merge evidence.


## Coverage registry blocker observed during naming cleanup (2026-09-05)

The repository naming cleanup ran `scripts/run_all_tests.sh` once. The gate
failed in coverage-matrix readiness with nine unclassified SQL packages,
unclassified SQL/host-tool test targets, an unclassified PostgreSQL `rlib`,
and a stale PostgreSQL `lib` classification. The naming cleanup changes no
SQL Cargo packages, targets, or coverage classifications.

Examples include `sifr_sql_mysql`, `sifr_sql_mysql_runtime`,
`sifr_sql_postgresql_runtime`, `sifr_sql_sqlite`, `sifr_sql_tool`,
`test:host_tool_cli`, `test:sql_migrations`, and `test:runtime_policies`.
The complete failure list is in `target/naming-cleanup/merge-gate.log` and
`target/verification/areas/coverage-matrix-merge-results.json`.

This issue owns reconciling the coverage registry with the existing SQL
package and target graph. No classification or coverage requirement was
weakened during naming cleanup. The merge gate was not repeated.

The subsequent demo directory follow-up ran its own final merge gate once on
2026-09-05 and reproduced the same SQL coverage classifications failure.
All 264 demo emitted companions passed freshness, along with the file-size,
HIR, Rust interop, and naming checks. No SQL classifications changed.
Evidence: `target/demo-layout/merge-gate.log`.

The abbreviated-label cleanup also ran its final merge gate once on 2026-09-05.
It reproduced the SQL package/target classification failures above. Demo
freshness, Rust interop matrix checks, naming checks, HIR, and file-size checks
passed. No SQL classification or dependency changed. Evidence:
`target/abbreviation-cleanup/merge-gate.log`.
